# Tetris-Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tetris game using Pygame. 

# Installation
- Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/Simarv07/Tetris-Game.git
- Install the required packages: pip install pygame
- Run the game: python main.py

NOTE: This requires a .env file which contains the credentials to the database. Without it, the game cannot run. Reach out to me at simarv07@gmail.com for the access token.

- Use the up arrow key to rotate the Tetrominoes.
- Use the down arrow key to speed up the falling of Tetrominoes.
- Press 'c' to hold the current Tetromino and swap it with the next one.
- Press 'space' to instantly drop the current Tetromino to the bottom.
