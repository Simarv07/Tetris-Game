# Tetris-Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tetris game using Pygame. 

## Installation
- Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/Simarv07/Tetris-Game.git
- Install the required packages: pip install pygame
- Run the game: python main.py

## How to Play
- Use the arrow keys to move the Tetrominoes left and right.
- Use the up arrow key to rotate the Tetrominoes.
- Use the down arrow key to speed up the falling of Tetrominoes.
- Press 'c' to hold the current Tetromino and swap it with the next one.
- Press 'space' to instantly drop the current Tetromino to the bottom.

## Note
I have commented out the code for integrating the leaderboard as it requires a .env file for database credentials making the game unaccessible to play for others.
